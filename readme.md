# Chain
## The second and better incarnation of [Chaîne](https://github.com/ConorOBrien-Foxx/Cha-ne)

I made Chaîne a while ago, and it was one of my first languages. However, that being the case, it was also rather shoddy, and now fails to work as intended. (Not to mention the non-ASCII characters in the name.) Therefore, I have made a second version. It is nowhere near complete, but is still semi-functional. Also, it will probably be just about as useful as the original language, just cleaner.

Perhaps this language is more of a spiritual successor to Chaîne, for no syntax is intentionally retained from Chaîne to Chain, except for the rule that the printable ASCII characters (along with tabs, newlines, and carriage returns) have no special effects, besides being data.
